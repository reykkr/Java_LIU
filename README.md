Welcome to my project portfolio showcasing my Java programming projects completed during my time at the Lebanese International University. This collection highlights my proficiency in Java programming, software development, and problem-solving. Each project reflects my dedication to producing high-quality code and demonstrates my understanding of key programming concepts.

These projects cover a range of topics including data structures, algorithms, user interface design, and more. From console applications to interactive graphical interfaces, my work showcases my ability to create functional and efficient software solutions. By applying best practices and adhering to coding standards, I have developed projects that not only solve problems but also contribute to a deeper understanding of Java programming.

I worked on these projects in the courses below:

CSCI250 - Introduction to Programming

CSCI300 - Intermediate Programming with Objects

CSCI378 - Data Structures and Algorithms
