Factorial and Strong Number Detector.

This Java program offers two distinct functions:

Factorial Calculation:

Users can input a positive integer n.
The program calculates the factorial of n using a recursive function.
The calculated factorial is displayed to the user.
Strong Number Identification:

Users can input an upper limit positive integer p.
The program identifies and prints the strong numbers between 1 and p.
A strong number is defined as a number whose sum of factorials of its digits equals the number itself.
The program uses a Scanner to receive user inputs and performs the calculations accordingly. It demonstrates the concepts of recursion and conditional checks to achieve the factorial calculation and strong number identification tasks.
