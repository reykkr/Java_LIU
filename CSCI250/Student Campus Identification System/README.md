Student Campus Identification System is a simple application designed to analyze student IDs and determine their corresponding campus based on the first digit of the ID. The program reads the number of students and their IDs from the user, then performs the following tasks:

For each student, it calculates the number of digits in the ID to ensure it has a length of 8.
If the ID length is valid, it calls the analyzeID function to determine the campus based on the first digit of the ID.
The program outputs the result, either indicating the campus or showing an error message if the ID length is not valid.
