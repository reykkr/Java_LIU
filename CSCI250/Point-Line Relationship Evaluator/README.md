Point-Line Relationship Evaluator is a Java program that allows users to input the coordinates of points and a specific 'x' value. The program then determines whether each point lies above a defined line on the coordinate plane. The line's equation, 2 * x + 1 > y, is used to assess the points' positions relative to the line. For each point provided, the program outputs whether the point is positioned above the line or not.

This program can be useful for visualizing and categorizing points based on their relative positions to a linear boundary. It demonstrates basic input handling, mathematical comparisons, and conditional logic in Java programming.
