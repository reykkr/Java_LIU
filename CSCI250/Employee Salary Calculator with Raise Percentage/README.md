Employee Salary Calculator with Raise Percentage is to calculate salary raises based on user input. Here's a summary of the program's functionality:

The program prompts the user to enter the name of an employee and their current salary in dollars.
It checks if the entered salary is less than $400 and displays a message indicating that the salary cannot be less than $400.
If the salary is between $400 and $1000, the program calculates a raise of 2.5% and displays the new salary with the raise applied.
If the salary is between $1000 and $2000, the program calculates a raise of 3.2% and displays the new salary with the raise applied.
If the salary is above $2000, the program calculates a raise of 3.9% (based on user input) and displays the new salary with the raise applied.
