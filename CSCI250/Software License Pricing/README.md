Software License Pricing calculates the cost of software licenses based on the number of users and the selected license type. Users are prompted to input the number of users and choose between two license types (0 or 1). The program then calculates and displays the total cost of the software licenses based on the selected license type. The program performs basic input validation to ensure the chosen license type is valid (either 0 or 1).
