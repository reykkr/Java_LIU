Work Management System is a Java program that models a simple employee management system. It includes classes to represent employees, such as Staff and Worker, within various departments. The Department class manages the employees, allowing addition and retrieval of staff and worker instances. The program provides functionality to calculate salaries for staff and workers, and it generates department descriptions with employee information.

The program's main features include:

Employee Class Hierarchy: The program implements an Employee class hierarchy with a base class (Employee) and two derived classes (Staff and Worker), each having specific attributes and methods related to their roles.

Department Management: The Department class is responsible for managing employees. It allows adding staff and workers to a department and provides methods to count the number of staff and workers in the department.

Salary Calculation: Both staff and workers have methods to calculate their salaries based on their specific attributes. The program considers the tax rate while calculating salaries.

User Interaction: The Test class acts as a user interface, allowing users to input employee information interactively. It then displays the salaries of staff and generates department descriptions with the list of employees.
