Strong Password Checker is a Java program designed to assess the strength of passwords entered by the user. The program enforces specific criteria for a password to be considered strong:

The password must be at least 8 characters long.
It should contain at least one uppercase letter.
It should contain at least one lowercase letter.
It should include at least one numerical digit.
It must have at least one of the characters '@', '#', or '$'.
The user is prompted to input passwords until they provide one that meets these requirements. Once a strong password is provided, the program terminates. This application serves as a useful tool to help users generate strong passwords that enhance their online security.
