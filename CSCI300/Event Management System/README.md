Event Management System is a Java application that implements the Event class to represent and manage various events. Each event is described by its description, organizer, budget, number of guests, and date. The system provides methods to assess the budget category of an event, generate an organizer code, and limit the number of guests. The application also includes a client class that creates an array of events, allows users to search for events by organizer, counts costly events, and displays event details and budget assessments. This system facilitates efficient organization, categorization, and analysis of events, offering insights into their budgets and other essential information.
