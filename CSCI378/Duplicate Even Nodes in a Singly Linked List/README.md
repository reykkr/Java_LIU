This Java code demonstrates how to create a method that duplicates even nodes within a Singly Linked List (SLL). The code defines a Node class and an SLL (Singly Linked List) class with essential methods. The createduplicateEvenNodes method takes an SLL as input and returns a new SLL with even nodes duplicated. The program illustrates the process using an example SLL and displays both the original and duplicated lists. This implementation allows for easy duplication of even nodes in a given SLL, showcasing linked list manipulation and traversal techniques.
