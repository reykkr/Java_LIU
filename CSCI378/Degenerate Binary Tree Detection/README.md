Degenerate Binary Tree Detection provides the implementation of the isDegenerate method in the BST class to determine whether a binary search tree (BST) is degenerate or not. A degenerate binary tree is one in which every node has either no children or only one child. The isDegenerate method recursively checks if each node has at most one child. The example provided demonstrates how to use the method to determine if a BST is degenerate.
