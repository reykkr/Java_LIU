Reordering Elements in Stacks provides an implementation of the store method that rearranges the elements in three nonempty stacks (R, S, and T) to store all elements originally in T below all of Sâ€™s original elements, while keeping the order intact. The temp stack is used to temporarily hold the elements from S before rearranging them. The example output demonstrates the final configuration of the stacks after reordering.
