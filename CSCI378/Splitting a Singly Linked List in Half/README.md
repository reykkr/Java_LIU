This Java program demonstrates how to split a singly linked list into two halves. The program defines a SLL class for singly linked list implementation, along with a splitListInHalf method that efficiently divides the list into two parts, maintaining equal or nearly equal sizes for both halves. The code showcases the use of slow and fast pointers to find the middle node, making the split operation robust and efficient. The Main class provides an example of how to use the splitListInHalf method on a sample linked list, emphasizing the functionality's practical application in real-world scenarios.
