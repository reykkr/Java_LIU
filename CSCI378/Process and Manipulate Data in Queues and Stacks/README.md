This Java program demonstrates how to perform data manipulation using queues and stacks. It includes two methods, one for manipulating a stack to extract even and odd numbers, and another for creating a new queue based on certain conditions. The program showcases fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms in Java, providing insight into how to work with stacks, queues, and node data objects. It serves as a practical example for learning data structure manipulation in Java programming.
